# Telephone Book Project in C

My final project for programming 1 course.

**Note:** This project is built using Visual Studio IDE. It might not work directly in other IDEs like CodeBlocks without a slight modifications.

## Coding style

- Use PascalCase for functions (except for `main`), structs, and unions names.
- Use camelCase for function parameters, local variables, structs members, and unions members.
- Use ALL_UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE to define macros.
- Prefix pointer variables with `p`. For example, `Date *pBirthDate`, not `Date *birthDate`. `char *` is an exception if the variable name is obvious to be a string.
- Use allman braces. Curly braces should be put in their own line.
- Use 4 spaces indentation instead of a tab. To let Visual Studio do that for you, **Tools** > **Options** > **Text Editor** > **C/C++** > **Tabs** > **Insert spaces**.
