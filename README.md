# Telephone Book Project in C

My final project for programming 1 course

## Coding style

- Use PascalCase for functions (except for `main`), structs, and unions names.
- Use camelCase for function parameters, local variables, structs members, and unions members.
- Use ALL_UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE to define macros.
- Use allman braces. Curly braces should be put in their own line.
- Prefix pointer variables with `p`. For example, `Date *pBirthDate`, not `Date *birthDate`.
